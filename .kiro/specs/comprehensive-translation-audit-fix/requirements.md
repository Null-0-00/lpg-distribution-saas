# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses comprehensive translation fixes across all navigation panel pages in the LPG Distributor Management System. The system currently has an internationalization (i18n) framework with English and Bengali translations, but there are inconsistencies, missing translations, and hardcoded text throughout the application. This feature will ensure all UI components including tables, forms, headings, sub-headings, buttons, and messages are properly translated across all navigation pages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want all navigation panel pages to display consistently translated content, so that I can use the application in my preferred language without encountering untranslated text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to any page from the navigation panel THEN all headings and sub-headings SHALL be translated using the translation system
2. WHEN I view tables on any page THEN all table headers, column names, and table actions SHALL be translated
3. WHEN I interact with forms THEN all form labels, placeholders, validation messages, and buttons SHALL be translated
4. WHEN I encounter error messages or notifications THEN they SHALL be displayed in the selected language
5. WHEN I view loading states or empty states THEN the messages SHALL be translated

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all hardcoded text to be replaced with translation keys, so that the application maintains consistency and can be easily extended to support additional languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN no hardcoded English or Bengali text SHALL exist in component JSX
2. WHEN a new translation key is needed THEN it SHALL be added to both English and Bengali translation objects
3. WHEN using translation functions THEN components SHALL use the `t()` function from the settings context
4. WHEN a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL fallback to the English translation or the key itself
5. WHEN translation keys are defined THEN they SHALL follow a consistent naming convention

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all navigation pages to work correctly when switching between languages, so that I can change my language preference and see immediate updates across all pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change the language setting THEN all currently visible text SHALL update to the new language immediately
2. WHEN I navigate between pages after changing language THEN all pages SHALL display content in the selected language
3. WHEN I refresh the page THEN the selected language SHALL persist and all content SHALL display correctly
4. WHEN switching languages THEN no layout breaks or UI issues SHALL occur
5. WHEN using dynamic content THEN it SHALL be formatted according to the selected language's locale

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent translation coverage across all navigation panel pages, so that every page provides the same level of language support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the Dashboard page THEN all components SHALL be fully translated
2. WHEN I visit the Sales page THEN all components SHALL be fully translated
3. WHEN I visit the Analytics page THEN all components SHALL be fully translated
4. WHEN I visit the Daily Sales Report page THEN all components SHALL be fully translated
5. WHEN I visit the Inventory page THEN all components SHALL be fully translated
6. WHEN I visit the Shipments page THEN all components SHALL be fully translated
7. WHEN I visit the Drivers page THEN all components SHALL be fully translated
8. WHEN I visit the Users page THEN all components SHALL be fully translated
9. WHEN I visit the Receivables page THEN all components SHALL be fully translated
10. WHEN I visit the Assets page THEN all components SHALL be fully translated
11. WHEN I visit the Expenses page THEN all components SHALL be fully translated
12. WHEN I visit the Reports page THEN all components SHALL be fully translated
13. WHEN I visit the Product Management page THEN all components SHALL be fully translated
14. WHEN I visit the Settings page THEN all components SHALL be fully translated

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want to verify that all translations are accurate and contextually appropriate, so that users receive high-quality localized content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing Bengali translations THEN they SHALL be grammatically correct and contextually appropriate
2. WHEN reviewing English translations THEN they SHALL use proper terminology for business operations
3. WHEN translations are displayed THEN they SHALL fit properly within UI components without overflow
4. WHEN technical terms are translated THEN they SHALL maintain their meaning and be understandable to users
5. WHEN reviewing date and number formatting THEN they SHALL follow the locale-specific conventions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling for translation failures, so that the application remains functional even when translations are missing or fail to load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL display the English fallback or the key name
2. WHEN the translation system fails to load THEN the application SHALL continue to function with English text
3. WHEN an invalid translation key is used THEN the system SHALL log the error and display a fallback
4. WHEN translation files are corrupted THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully
5. WHEN network issues prevent translation loading THEN cached translations SHALL be used as fallback
