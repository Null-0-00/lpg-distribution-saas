# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing LPG Distributor Management System (LDMS) web application into a comprehensive mobile application that maintains all current functionality while providing native mobile experiences for field operations. The mobile app will serve LPG distributors, drivers, and managers who need to access the system while on-the-go, with particular emphasis on offline capabilities for field sales operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an LPG distributor manager, I want a native mobile app that provides all web functionality, so that I can manage my business operations from anywhere without being tied to a desktop computer.

3. WHEN the app is used on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL provide responsive layouts optimized for mobile devices
4. WHEN network connectivity is available THEN the system SHALL sync data in real-time with the web application
5. IF the user has appropriate permissions THEN the system SHALL allow access to sales management, inventory control, and financial reporting features

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a field driver, I want to record sales transactions offline, so that I can continue working even when I don't have reliable internet connectivity in remote areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mobile app detects no internet connection THEN the system SHALL enable offline mode with local data storage
2. WHEN a sales transaction is recorded offline THEN the system SHALL store the transaction locally with a pending sync status
3. WHEN internet connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync all pending transactions to the server
4. WHEN offline data conflicts with server data THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution options to the user
5. WHEN working offline THEN the system SHALL provide access to cached inventory levels and customer information
6. IF sync fails due to validation errors THEN the system SHALL notify the user and allow manual correction

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want native mobile features like push notifications and camera integration, so that I can receive real-time alerts and capture delivery receipts efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inventory levels reach critical thresholds THEN the system SHALL send push notifications to relevant users
2. WHEN a sales transaction is completed THEN the system SHALL allow users to capture photos of delivery receipts using the device camera
3. WHEN important business events occur THEN the system SHALL send targeted push notifications based on user roles
4. WHEN the app is backgrounded THEN the system SHALL continue to receive and display notifications
5. WHEN photos are captured THEN the system SHALL compress and attach them to relevant transactions
6. IF the device supports biometric authentication THEN the system SHALL offer fingerprint or face unlock options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the mobile app to integrate seamlessly with our existing infrastructure, so that we don't need to maintain separate systems or duplicate data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mobile app makes API calls THEN the system SHALL use the existing Next.js API routes without modification
2. WHEN user data is accessed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same multi-tenant data isolation as the web application
3. WHEN authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL use the existing NextAuth.js system with JWT tokens
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use the same Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL database
5. WHEN security policies are applied THEN the system SHALL enforce the same role-based access control as the web version
6. IF API changes are made THEN the system SHALL automatically reflect those changes in the mobile app

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the mobile app to provide the same comprehensive reporting and analytics, so that I can make data-driven decisions regardless of which platform I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing financial reports THEN the system SHALL display income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow analysis
2. WHEN viewing sales analytics THEN the system SHALL provide interactive charts and graphs optimized for mobile viewing
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL allow export to PDF and sharing via mobile sharing options
4. WHEN viewing dashboard data THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates and refresh capabilities
5. WHEN analyzing performance metrics THEN the system SHALL display driver performance, inventory trends, and financial KPIs
6. IF data visualization is complex THEN the system SHALL provide simplified mobile-friendly chart alternatives

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want fast performance and smooth navigation, so that I can efficiently complete my daily tasks without delays or frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display the main interface within 3 seconds on average mobile devices
2. WHEN navigating between screens THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions with loading times under 1 second
3. WHEN loading data lists THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and lazy loading for optimal performance
4. WHEN using forms THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation and auto-save capabilities
5. WHEN the app is backgrounded and resumed THEN the system SHALL restore the user's previous state and context
6. IF network requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious business owner, I want the mobile app to maintain the same security standards as the web application, so that sensitive business data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption for all API communications
2. WHEN data is stored locally THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information using device-level encryption
3. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh tokens or prompt for re-authentication
4. WHEN the app detects suspicious activity THEN the system SHALL log security events and notify administrators
5. WHEN users access sensitive features THEN the system SHALL require additional authentication for financial operations
6. IF the device is compromised THEN the system SHALL provide remote wipe capabilities for business data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a deployment manager, I want the mobile app to be easily distributable and updatable, so that we can efficiently roll out updates and manage app versions across our organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN updates are available THEN the system SHALL notify users and provide in-app update mechanisms
3. WHEN deploying to app stores THEN the system SHALL follow platform-specific guidelines and approval processes
4. WHEN distributing internally THEN the system SHALL support enterprise distribution methods for beta testing
5. WHEN version conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum version requirements for API compatibility
6. IF critical security updates are needed THEN the system SHALL support forced updates with user notification
