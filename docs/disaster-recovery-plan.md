# LPG Distributor SaaS - Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive disaster recovery (DR) strategy for the LPG Distributor SaaS platform. The plan ensures business continuity, data protection, and rapid recovery from various failure scenarios.

## Recovery Objectives

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

- **Critical Services**: 2 hours
- **Non-Critical Services**: 4 hours
- **Full System Recovery**: 8 hours

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

- **Database**: Maximum 15 minutes of data loss
- **File Storage**: Maximum 1 hour of data loss
- **Configuration**: Maximum 4 hours of data loss

## Backup Strategy

### Database Backups

#### Primary Database (PostgreSQL)

```yaml
# Automated daily backups
Schedule: Daily at 2:00 AM UTC
Retention: 30 days
Location:
  - Primary: AWS S3 (us-east-1)
  - Secondary: AWS S3 (eu-west-1)
Format: Compressed SQL dump with encryption

# Continuous WAL archiving
Frequency: Every 5 minutes
Retention: 7 days
Purpose: Point-in-time recovery
```

#### Backup Verification

- Daily backup integrity checks
- Weekly restore testing to staging environment
- Monthly full disaster recovery simulation

### Application Data Backups

#### File Storage (S3)

```yaml
Replication: Cross-region replication enabled
Versioning: Enabled with lifecycle policies
Backup: Daily sync to secondary region
Retention: 90 days for current versions, 30 days for deleted objects
```

#### Configuration Backups

```yaml
Kubernetes Configs: Daily backup to Git repository
Secrets: Encrypted backup to secure storage
SSL Certificates: Automated backup with cert-manager
Environment Variables: Version controlled and encrypted
```

## Infrastructure Redundancy

### Multi-Zone Deployment

```yaml
Primary Region: us-east-1
  - Availability Zones: us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c
  - Database: Multi-AZ deployment
  - Application: 3 replicas across zones
  - Load Balancer: Cross-zone distribution

Secondary Region: eu-west-1
  - Standby database replica
  - Dormant application deployment
  - Ready for activation within 30 minutes
```

### Kubernetes Cluster Redundancy

```yaml
Control Plane: 3 master nodes across AZs
Worker Nodes: Minimum 3 nodes per AZ
Auto-scaling: Enabled with resource limits
Pod Disruption Budget: Minimum 2 replicas always available
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Checks

```yaml
Application Health:
  - HTTP endpoint: /api/health
  - Database connectivity
  - Redis connectivity
  - External service dependencies

Infrastructure Health:
  - Node resource utilization
  - Network connectivity
  - Storage availability
  - SSL certificate validity
```

### Alert Thresholds

```yaml
Critical Alerts:
  - Application down > 2 minutes
  - Database connection failure
  - SSL certificate expired
  - Backup failure
  - High error rate (>5%)

Warning Alerts:
  - High memory usage (>80%)
  - High CPU usage (>80%)
  - Slow response times (>2s)
  - Certificate expiring (<30 days)
```

## Failure Scenarios and Response

### Scenario 1: Single Pod Failure

```yaml
Impact: Minimal (automatic recovery)
Detection: Kubernetes liveness probes
Response: Automatic pod restart
RTO: 30 seconds
RPO: 0 (no data loss)

Actions:
1. Kubernetes automatically restarts failed pod
2. Monitor application logs for root cause
3. Update deployment if code fix required
```

### Scenario 2: Node Failure

```yaml
Impact: Temporary service degradation
Detection: Node monitoring alerts
Response: Pod rescheduling to healthy nodes
RTO: 2-5 minutes
RPO: 0 (no data loss)

Actions:
1. Kubernetes reschedules pods to healthy nodes
2. Auto-scaling triggers if needed
3. Replace failed node
4. Investigate root cause
```

### Scenario 3: Availability Zone Failure

```yaml
Impact: Service degradation, possible brief outage
Detection: Multi-zone monitoring
Response: Traffic rerouting to healthy zones
RTO: 5-10 minutes
RPO: 0 (no data loss)

Actions:
1. Load balancer routes traffic to healthy zones
2. Scale up pods in remaining zones
3. Database fails over to replica in healthy zone
4. Monitor for zone recovery
```

### Scenario 4: Database Failure

```yaml
Impact: Complete service outage
Detection: Database health checks
Response: Failover to standby replica
RTO: 10-15 minutes
RPO: <5 minutes

Actions:
1. Automatic failover to read replica
2. Promote replica to primary
3. Update application connection strings
4. Restore from backup if corruption detected
5. Investigate and fix primary database
```

### Scenario 5: Complete Region Failure

```yaml
Impact: Complete service outage
Detection: Regional monitoring
Response: Activate secondary region
RTO: 30-60 minutes
RPO: <15 minutes

Actions:
1. Activate disaster recovery runbook
2. Restore database from backup in secondary region
3. Deploy application to secondary region
4. Update DNS to point to secondary region
5. Notify customers of temporary service impact
```

### Scenario 6: Data Corruption

```yaml
Impact: Data integrity issues
Detection: Data validation checks, user reports
Response: Point-in-time recovery
RTO: 1-4 hours (depending on corruption extent)
RPO: <15 minutes

Actions:
1. Identify corruption scope and timeline
2. Stop application writes to prevent further corruption
3. Restore from backup to point before corruption
4. Replay WAL logs if needed
5. Validate data integrity
6. Resume normal operations
```
