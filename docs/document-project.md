- Subscription-based access control
- Scalable infrastructure supporting unlimited tenants
- Role-based authentication (Admin/Manager)

## 🗄️ Database Schema & Business Logic

### Core Entities (20+ Tables)
1. **Tenant Management**: Multi-tenant isolation with subscription status
2. **User Management**: Role-based access with Admin/Manager roles
3. **Product Catalog**: Company-product relationships (Aygaz, Jamuna, etc.)
4. **Driver Management**: Active/inactive status with performance tracking
5. **Sales System**: Package/Refill sales with payment tracking
6. **Inventory Management**: Real-time cylinder tracking with exact formulas
7. **Receivables**: Cash and cylinder receivables with automated calculations
8. **Financial Management**: Assets, liabilities, expenses with categorization
9. **Audit System**: Comprehensive logging for all operations

### Critical Business Formulas (Implemented Exactly)

#### Inventory Calculations
```typescript
// Package Sale: -1 Full Cylinder, no Empty Cylinder change
// Refill Sale: -1 Full Cylinder, +1 Empty Cylinder

Today's Full Cylinders = Yesterday's Full + Package Purchase + Refill Purchase - Total Sales
Today's Empty Cylinders = Yesterday's Empty + Refill Sales + Empty Cylinders Buy/Sell
```

#### Receivables Calculations
```typescript
Cash Receivables Change = driver_sales_revenue - cash_deposits - discounts
Cylinder Receivables Change = driver_refill_sales - cylinder_deposits
Today's Total = Yesterday's Total + Today's Changes
```
