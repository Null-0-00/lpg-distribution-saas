### Integration Approach Strategy

**Capacitor Integration Pattern**

- Install Capacitor as development dependency to existing Next.js project
- Configure Android platform without modifying existing web build
- Implement native plugins (camera, push notifications) as progressive enhancements
- Maintain existing web deployment alongside new mobile build pipeline

**API Compatibility Maintenance**

- Zero modifications to existing API endpoints
- Mobile app consumes same REST/GraphQL endpoints as web application
- Existing authentication tokens work seamlessly in mobile context
- Real-time updates maintain consistency between web and mobile sessions

### Code Organization Standards

**Project Structure Enhancement**

```
/capacitor/           # Mobile-specific configuration
/src/components/mobile/  # Mobile-optimized component variants
/src/hooks/mobile/    # Mobile-specific React hooks
/src/styles/mobile/   # Mobile-specific CSS adjustments
/android/            # Generated Android project (git-ignored)
```

**Development Workflow Integration**

- Existing development server supports mobile preview via Capacitor Live Reload
- Current linting and type-checking applies to mobile enhancements
- Existing test suite covers mobile functionality through web interface testing
- Mobile builds integrate with current CI/CD without disrupting web deployments

### Deployment and Operations Planning

**Build Pipeline Enhancement**

- Web build: Existing `npm run build` remains unchanged
- Mobile build: New `npm run build:mobile` for Android APK generation
- Development: `npm run dev:mobile` for mobile development with live reload
- Testing: Existing test suite validates mobile functionality

**Distribution Strategy**

- **Web Deployment**: Current deployment process unchanged
- **Mobile Distribution**: Android APK builds for internal testing and Play Store submission
- **Update Mechanism**: Web updates automatically available in mobile app
- **Version Management**: Mobile app version tracks web application releases

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**

- **Performance**: Web-view performance may impact complex financial calculations
  - _Mitigation_: Performance testing and optimization of critical workflows
- **Platform Limitations**: Some native features may require platform-specific implementations
  - _Mitigation_: Progressive enhancement approach with fallbacks
